## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

```{r}
library(curl)
```
Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
z <- file.choose()
```

```{r}
z1 <- curl(z)
```
 
```{r}
z2 <- read.csv(z1, header = TRUE, sep = ",", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

```{r}
f <- f <- curl(file.choose())
```

```{r}
d <- read.csv(f, header = TRUE, sep = ",", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```
Error in open.connection(file, "rt") : Port number ended with '\'
```{r}
library(curl)
f <- f <- curl("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fuzzyatelin/fuzzyatelin.github.io/master/AN597_Fall17/zombies.csv")
d <- read.csv(f, header = TRUE, sep = ",", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
head(d)
```

```{r}
aggregate(x = d["female"], by = d["age"], FUN = "mean", na.rm = TRUE)
```
#Quiz 2
I dot know how to do this so I'll be seeing you in office hours
```{r}
f$female <- f$gender(Male=FALSE)
```
```{r}
df2<-d[c('first_name','last_name','gender','height','weight','zombies_killed')]
df2
```
im not sure how to use the mutate thing 
```{r}
heightgreater <-mutate(df2, height = height>65)
```
```{r}
height <- c(1:1000)
zombies_killed <- seq(1,1000)

plot(height, zombies_killed, type="l")
```
I belive this is just the general height and im trying to figure out how to break height into two fiffrent catagories but cant figure that out or how to get just females
